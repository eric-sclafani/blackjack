# Overview

- This is my take on how a fun Blackjack game can be implemented in Python.

- Code is still highly WIP and a tad bit messy.

# Current features
- PC (player character) can specify how many NPCs to play with
- NPCs are instantiated and all players get their hand distributed to them

# Planned features
- Different betting amount tables
- NPCs will have their own rules that determine what they bet, whether they hit, fold,etc... 
-Probably more that I forgot...
